## About Me
I bring to the field of SQL Server Development a background in government, military and industry.

While gaining experience as a community law enforcement volunteer, I studied Administration of Justice. Participating in local government inspired me to join the United States Coast Guard. My enlisted duties were to assist with the enforcement of maritime laws and conduct safety audits. In addition, I was trained as a repair welder and I was surprised to discover that I possessed a talent for this vocation despite having no prior metalworking experience.

After departing the Coast Guard, I put my newfound welding skills to work in structural-steel fabrication and data center construction. I gained an introduction to the fields of Industrial Control Systems and Network Security while I worked alongside data center professionals. Wanting to learn more about computer networking and security, I returned to school and studied Information Systems Security. Upon completing my Bachelorâ€™s degree, I launched an eclectic career in information technology.

My professional focus includes designing, deploying, managing and securing Microsoft data warehouses. These data storage architectures are being used to support globally distributed building management systems.
